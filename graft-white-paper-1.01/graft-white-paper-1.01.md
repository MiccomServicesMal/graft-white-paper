# Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>
Graft is a global, open-sourced, blockchain-based, decentralized payment gateway and processing platform that anyone can use.
Any buyer and merchant can use Graft in a completely decentralized and inexpensive way. Graft ecosystem is open so anyone can participate by maintaining Graft blockchain and implementing network services.

Graft employs payment processing protocols and flows similar to traditional electronic payment systems such as credit, debit, and prepaid cards, which are already familiar to and trusted by millions of users and merchants around the world. This approach enables easier and faster adoption of Graft as a mainstream payment platform, while eliminating the need in centralized intermediaries (payment gateways and processors) currently required to facilitate transactions between buyers and merchants.

Bitcoin[1] was created as an “online cash” - very secure but relatively slow settlement system which was unable to replace payment cards online or compete with both plastic cards and paper cash in brick-and-mortar stores (Figure 1).

Even though some existing cryptocurrencies2 have improved confirmation times, they are still unable to process essential transactions types such as authorization and completion, which makes their adoption by retail, hospitality, and convenience store industries impossible without using intermediaries - payment processors and gateways3 - who fill the gap (Figure 2). However, the very existence of payment processor, which is typically a centralized commercial organization regulated by government and controlled by shareholders, as an element of crypto payment transaction contradicts the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies: decentralization, privacy, and independence.

Most merchants are unable to accept cryptocurrencies without third-party payment processor due to uniqueness of the way blockchain networks process transactions, which is conceptually different from traditional electronic payment methods such as payment cards or Paypal. Although the overall concept of plastic card payments may have been outdated, there are technologies developed around them that accumulated enormous amount of merchant experience and user trust which cannot be abandoned overnight. Those technologies include real-time authorization protocols and smart cards.
There are several major differences between the ways traditional and cryptocurrency payment systems handle transactions, which in most cases make cryptocurrencies less attractive for merchants and/or consumers. Here is the list of technical limitations and business flaws of the existing cryptocurrencies comparing to traditional electronic payments: 

* Lack of Essential Transaction Types
* Unsuitable Payment Flows
* Long Confirmation Times
* Unbalanced and Unpredictable Transaction Fees
* Inability to Process Micropayments and Repeating Charges (Subscriptions)
* Lack of Offline Transactions support
* Low Scalability
* Volatility
* Incomplete Security
* Lack of Privacy Due to Traceability of Blockchain 
* Lack of Trust between Buyer and Merchant
* Questionable Utility
* Poor Usability of End-User Interfaces
* Lack of Customer Support 

By addressing all those issues, Graft elevates crypto payment processing to a new level, and makes possible their wide acceptance by mainstream merchants and consumers for the first time without violating the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies. Let’s review each of those issues with greater detail and see how Graft addresses them.

## The Value of Decentralized Payment Processing <a name="TheValue"></a>

Why would a buyer want to start using cryptocurrency instead of (or in addition to) plastic cards or PayPal or Apple Pay, and why would a merchant want to accept cryptocurrency in addition to (or instead of) existing payment methods? Obviously, if we don’t find the right answers to those simple questions, there is no point to create this document.

While the answer to the first part of this question may consists of several elements as there might be multiple reasons (and combinations of them) to individuals to keep their money in a form of cryptocurrency, the answer to the second part of this question is relatively simple. Merchants always want to extend their customer base to increase their revenues, and if they identify a significant group of potential customers who prefer, for any reason, to use cryptocurrency, they will start accepting cryptocurrency. And Graft provides a unique opportunity for merchants to accept crypto payments from their buyers without any middlemen and with near zero fees. 

However, there may be additional value. In some cases, merchant might want to know the real identity of the buyer in order to comply with laws and regulations, for example, to make sure the buyer is older than 21 to be allowed to purchase some items. 

Since Graft is both decentralized payment processor and cryptocurrency, it is able to facilitate the full payment cycle without other cryptocurrencies or assets involved. However, in addition to decentralization and right for privacy, there is a freedom of choice which is another important fundamental liberal principle. Moreover, there might be a commercial need for diversity of cryptocurrencies for both buyers and merchants. Therefore, Graft will support Bitcoin and several major cryptocurrencies as additional choice for buyers and acceptable method of payoff for merchants. This feature will eliminate the need for merchant to integrate with multiple (centralized) payment software providers, and for user to sign up for centralized services and learn and maintain multiple wallet apps. It is important to note that merchants will have to accommodate higher risks and additional expenses associated with acceptance of alternative cryptocurrencies due to their slower confirmation times and higher transaction fees.
